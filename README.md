# freeCodeCamp
This is my run through of the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. Included in the README is a blog of my process in doing it. While I initially started poking at fCC a while back (I only got through about 60% of the Responsive Web Deisgn certificate), I'm only now (11/5/2023) actually committing to it.

## Responsive Web Design

### Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
This one was a little dry for me, but that's only because I've done an "intro to..." style thing for HTML and CSS SO MANY TIMES NOW. I am trying to escape the tutorial hell. Most recently, I attempted to go through another "development course" from Pirate King on YouTube. It was a fine start, but part of what was frustrating for me was that it was just a copy/paste of another creator on YouTube (Traversy Media).

### Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
Again, very similar experience to the Cat Photo App - I've done this before, so it seems a little repetitive to me, but I think that's a completment more than anything, it is very thorough and helps to get your reps in.

### Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers
The repitition that the instruction gives is nice to help remember what it is that you're exactly trying to do and *why*. I am listening to episode #102 of the freeCodeCamp podcast right now, and something that Joel Spolsky notes is that you can have generative AI give you the code, but it will still make errors, and if you don't know the *why* behind how something is supposed to work, you'll never actually be able to identify the error. So that's what I'm committing to in this process -- really learn the *why*.

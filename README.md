# freeCodeCamp

This is my run through of the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. Included in the README is a blog of my process in doing it. While I initially started poking at fCC a while back (I only got through about 60% of the Responsive Web Deisgn certificate), I'm only now (11/5/2023) actually committing to it.

## Responsive Web Design

*A while back, I completed a **lot** of this first course, but I went back and restarted **all** of my progress. I'll mark the sections that are repeats for me with a #repeat.*

### Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App

This one was a little dry for me, but that's only because I've done an "intro to..." style thing for HTML and CSS SO MANY TIMES NOW. I am trying to escape the tutorial hell. Most recently, I attempted to go through another "development course" from Pirate King on YouTube. It was a fine start, but part of what was frustrating for me was that it was just a copy/paste of another creator on YouTube (Traversy Media). #repeat

### Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu

Again, very similar experience to the Cat Photo App - I've done this before, so it seems a little repetitive to me, but I think that's a completment more than anything, it is very thorough and helps to get your reps in. #repeat

### Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers

The repitition that the instruction gives is nice to help remember what it is that you're exactly trying to do and *why*. I am listening to episode #102 of the freeCodeCamp podcast right now, and something that Joel Spolsky notes is that you can have generative AI give you the code, but it will still make errors, and if you don't know the *why* behind how something is supposed to work, you'll never actually be able to identify the error. So that's what I'm committing to in this process -- really learn the *why*. #repeat

### Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

This was a good course to see how to manipulate individual items with HTML/CSS to get them to appear exactly where you want them to on the DOM. #repeat

### *Certification Project* Survey Form

Ok, next up is a bigger project -- my own survey form. completing this project is required for my certification. This one is cool! It's a lot less hand-holding and more "go figure it out!" Instead of step-by-step instructions, I get to write my own code and it will run test to see if I have completed all that I need to or not.

So... this survey form... I spent about an hour and a half on it. I feel like it's hard to take it seriously when there isn't a clear use for it at the end of the workflow. The submit button doesn't do anything... and I wasn't given a clear "create a survey form for this" task. I'm not the most creative type, so it's hard to come up with a good-looking/interesting page, but I did something... and that's what matters, right?

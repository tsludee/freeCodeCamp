# freeCodeCamp
This is my run through of the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. Included in the README is a blog of my process in doing it. While I initially started poking at fCC a while back, I'm only now (11/5/2023) actually committing to it.

## Responsive Web Design

### Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
This one was a little dry for me, but that's only because I've done an "intro to..." style thing for HTML and CSS SO MANY TIMES NOW. I am trying to escape the tutorial hell. Most recently, I attempted to go through another "development course" from Pirate King on YouTube. It was a fine start, but part of what was frustrating for me was that it was just a copy/paste of another creator on YouTube (Traversy Media).

### Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
Again, very similar experience to the Cat Photo App - I've done this before, so it seems a little repetitive to me, but I think that's a completment more than anything, it is very thorough and helps to get your reps in.
